# PreferenceRobot

The PreferenceRobot project aims to test newly acquired knowledge in .NET Core and utilize it for future use and support. Primarily, an ASP.NET Core Web API is used in the project. This API is used to communicate with various clients (web, mobile, desktop applications, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core:** A framework that enables rapid and efficient development of Web APIs.
- **Web API:** A protocol used to communicate with clients over the HTTP protocol.
- **AutoMapper:** An object mapping library. Facilitates data transfer between objects.

- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A standard used in the authentication and authorization processes.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** A design pattern that separates write and read operations into separate operations.
- **Onion Architecture:** Layered architectural approach. It allows the code to be divided into layers and reverses dependencies.
- **Mail Service:** A service used for sending emails.
- **Logger (with Seq):** A library that provides logging functionality. Seq is used for more detailed viewing of logs.
- **Database (MS SQL Server):** A relational database management system.
